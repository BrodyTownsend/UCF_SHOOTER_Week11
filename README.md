# UCF_SHOOTER_Week11
Team Project

The first push was just uploading the basic files for the Unity Game that was made during zoom.
The only file that was changed by Brody was "Assets/Scripts/Player.cs". This makes it so the player can loop when moving left or right, but stops at the bottom and does not move above halfway.
